# Time Tracker

For Hannah. With love or whatever.

## Getting Started

If you're used to web development, then things are pretty straightforward. You can run the app locally with `npm run dev` and then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

If you don't know how to wield the web, then you can run [bash.sh](bash.sh) to set everything up for you. Magic.
